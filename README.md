The course MAC0122 - Principles of Algorithm Development was taken by me in 2022 during my bachelor's degree in physics. Here are stored the programming exercises done during the course, where each exercise is categorized by lesson topics, indicated by numerical identifiers. The course aims to introduce algorithm development and basic principles of software development, addressing correctness, efficiency, elegance, and documentation.

Some of the topics covered include: Elementary data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, and binary trees. Algorithms for elementary tasks like sorting, enumeration, and searching.

In the "Projeto Definitivo" folder, the final assessment of the course is stored, where the task was to develop a rudimentary text editor. In this editor, concepts and algorithms covered throughout the course were applied.
